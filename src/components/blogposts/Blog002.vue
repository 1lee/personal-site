            Tip 5
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>Eat. Sleep. Breathe.</b>
            </span>
          </h3>

          <p class="text-white">
            This probably should have been Tip 1, but its Tip 5 because I just thought about it, you’ll sort it out. Don’t forget to eat. If you can, eat something green (not apple Jolly Ranchers) and leafy. A little coffee is good. Protein is good. Take it easy with the starch, and salt. Avoid sugar.
            Sleep. Get a nice bed and sleep. Sleep so that when you’re awake, you’re awake. Don’t half sleep, and then be half awake, you’ll get half done. Here’s a cool thing. Some days you’ll go to bed with some unsolved coding problem. You’ll have a dream, and wake up with a solution. If you follow Tip 2, and saturate yourself with info, your subconscious mind will code for you while you sleep! Boss!
            Breathe. Look away from the monitor, get up and step outside into the sun (or moonlight), and breathe deeply from your diaphragm. Get your heartrate up, jog, chase a squirrel, do jumping jacks, look at your student loan statement… too far? The point is, sitting down for long periods hunched over a screen is very very bad, you must downward dog, or cat stretch or something to break it up.

            Tip 6
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>Not knowing is awesome!</b>
            </span>
          </h3>

          <p
            class="text-white"
          >You are going to NOT know what something is, and NOT know how to do something, and NOT know why we do it. It’s going to be great! That is the feeling we get just before we learn something new. How exciting! Don’t panic. I used to panic. It’s a stressful feeling that doesn’t help. Just breathe. Breathe and then Google it. Not knowing has made me an incredible Googler. Don’t search about the answers that people had years ago! Doesn’t tech move fast? Don’t do it the way people did it three years ago, chances are there are better ways to do it that have been tested within the last 12 months. Most languages share similar syntax and concepts. If I have a question about javascript, I’ll prepend the word javascript before the rest of the query so that i don’t get results for a different language. If I just need a quick and simple example, then maybe I’ll check Stack Overflow or W3schools results, for more nitty gritty, check out the MDN or W3 spec sheets.</p>

            Tip 7
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>Git 'er done</b>
            </span>
          </h3>
          <p class="text-white">
            I had a terrible thing happen to me. I’m warning you because I don’t want it to happen to you. Like many developers, I had a folder on my laptop called “Experiments”. In this folder I had tons and tons of ideas sketched out, tinkering with APIs, tutorials I followed along with etc., not to mention a slew of projects that I hadn’t yet qualified for my portfolio.
            One fateful night after working late and then burning the midnight oil on some project. I nodded off. I was so tired that I headed straight for bed without putting up my hardware. I have small children so I ALWAYS put my things up and away from their sticky paws when not in use; but this night, I left my laptop out on the coffee table.
            The next morning I opened my laptop eager to pick up where I left off, only to find that the trackpad and keyboard input was so wacky that I couldn’t even log in. It turns out that while I was asleep, my daughter in an attempt to play Minecraft, destroyed my computer with blunt force, and water… the details are still mysterious, but the point is I lost a lot of work. If I had been practicing proper version control via one of the Git clients, or at least had regular back ups, the loss wouldn’t have been so catastrophic. I hate to sound redundant but, redundancy, redundancy, redundancy!

          <h3 class="text-white">
            Tip 8
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>Music please!</b>
            </span>
          </h3>

          <p class="text-white">
            I may lose some of you here because music is highly subjective, but I can share with you what works for me. If you followed my instructions from Tip 4b, then by now you possess a glorious pair of over-the-ear headphones. Personally, I have two specific listening modes, depending on what I’m trying to achieve. For instance, let’s say I’m brainstorming the concept for a new video game. The plot, the characters, the art etc. For me, classical music is best. Most classical has a narrative structure that resonates well for conceptualizing and storytelling.
            On the other hand, if I am writing code, I find the sounds that focus my attention best are any of the “lo-fi hip hop” stations on youtube or mobile apps. You’re probably thinking hip-hop? really? The thing about the lo-fi hip hop is it usually has less that 2% lyric content, but mostly very relaxing, and persistent grooves that more or less fade into ambience, so much so that nothing fills your head except the code before you. Unless the beat is particularly sick, of course. At least, that’s how I experience it. You may focus best coding to Deathcore… no judgement.

          <h3 class="text-white">
            Tip 9
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>Ewww bugs!</b>
            </span>
          </h3>

          <p class="text-white">
            No, bugs are your friends! Nothing helps you learn more than a really big, frustrating, hours long, days long, cry about in fetal position, BUG. If you’re in a crunch for time, and you end a coding session stuck with the same bug you started with, you’re liable to quit forever. DON’T. You will get through it, have faith and keep plugging away at it. Here’s a ray of hope, it may not even be your fault!
            I can remember a time when I was building a site using this popular framework. This framework was so popular, I felt that anything that I could ever ask would have already been asked, and answered by someone else. Alas, my project errored out at runtime with error codes and references that led so deep within the framework’s code that I was bewildered. I grew frustrated debugging, searching error codes, and message boards trying to figure it out. It turns out that the framework’s development team were in between releases, and the bugs were resolved within about 48 hours. To this day, I can’t tell you what in the framework was broken, nor what was fixed. I did however, learn a lot of other important things during those 48 hours!

            Tip 10
            <span class="paragraph-title">
              <b>You are the real deal.</b>

          >As you grow as a developer, you will encounter countless great minds and charismatic characters, and yes, they are usually deserving of your reverence. However, aren’t you a great mind? expressed by a magnetic charisma? Maybe. Regardless, don’t fall victim to self doubt. Keep plugging at it and master your craft. Only you know what you don’t know. Take note, and move on. Oftentimes we are surprised to find out how much expertise we’ve acquired, because we’re focused on mastering the next challenge. Be gentle with the self-critique, you’re not an imposter. Chances are, if you’ve spent any amount of time in study, you’re probably really impressive by now!</p>
