          >Teaching myself to code, while working full time in a non-IT job and rolling with the day-to-day punches of raising a young family has for me been a master’s class in time management. Make no mistake, it is hard, but not impossible. Here are some time-bending, space-bending, mind-bending suggestions to help you level up, where you otherwise could not.</p>

            Some people on the internets are going to say that you need at least two or three hours per day to teach yourself a programming language. I know where they’re coming from, and I agree that is ideal to learn a language fast. Before you develop a workflow, you can spend 30 minutes or more initializing IDEs, http-servers, organizing workspace etc. Not to mention that many problems may take more than a little time to wrap your head around. Unfortunately, many of us who aspire to this field simply don’t have the kind of time it takes to take up coding head on.. Never fear. There is a hack to bypass the luxurious four hours per day of uninterrupted learning.
            Saturation. Listen to podcasts, in your car, on your commute, while you sleep, while secretly wearing airpods with hair over your ears. Get it how you can get it! When coding is always on your mind, the sorry 45 minutes that you may be able to dedicate to the actually writing code will be richer because you can do it in the context of a conversation you heard on a podcast. Perhaps the presenters divulged some info that may have otherwise stumped you, wiping out your whole measly 45 minutes of study time. Instead, you knew what to do before you even got started. Go you!

Then you’re going to sit in the car and scroll through inconsequential stuff on your phone for an hour until they’re done with their errand. You’ll reach the end of your feed, bleary eyed and resentful for all the time you wasted. You should of brought your laptop! Your battery doesn’t hold charge? Buy a new battery you miser! No wifi? Add mobile hotspot to your plan, it’s like $10 a promise you.</p>

It's something like half a gazillion times more powerful than the computer you used when you were on MySpace in the olden days. Even the jenky free phone you got with your wireless plan is Star Trek level compared to 10 years ago. Do yourself a favor. If you can help it, get a phone with a big screen, 6” or better, and a bluetooth mini keyboard, really cheap on that big retail website. See what I did there?! Now you can leave your laptop at home, and go JSFiddle, or CodePen from your phone and not be that laptop person.</p>

              <b>Be Present</b>

          >This is a touchy one because maybe not everyone has the EQ to pull this off with finesse. You need to be PRESENT when your loved ones are talking to you. Not present as in the same room; I’m talking about active feedback, eye contact, follow up questions, deep penetrating attention. When your kid approaches you for the 17th time in a row with a drawing that is exactly the same as the last 16, you must evaluate it as if contemplating the Sistine Chapel. Your significant other is going to fill you in on every detail about a show you’ve never seen before, and retell a joke they saw on social media, and you’re not going to get it. Just smile. Nod, and say something supportive. Got it? You are becoming a better listener, you are giving constructive feedback, and reciprocating. Your friends and loved ones, no matter how much time they spend with you, feel like they have 110% whenever you ARE around. It may seem cool to be aloof and unavailable, but people will get over it, and over YOU. If you don’t make this Tip apart of the new and better you that you are becoming, DO NOT attempt Tip 4b, just skip it.</p>

            Ok. There is a magical item that all developers should have in their treasure chest of wonders. You shall procure for yourself, an item that is known as “over-the-ear headphones”. If you can get the noise cancelling variety, you have taken steps into a whole new world! If you have practiced and been transformed by the advice from Tip 4a so that being present isn’t new or awkward to those around you, then proceed with the following steps.
            You must train those around you to respect your quiet time. When you sit down and place the enchanted headphones upon your head, you will send a powerful message to those around you that, “I am invisible. You will carry on as if I am not here!”. When the kid or significant other approaches you, the 1st time, let them know that you are focused on something right now, and will engage them later (make sure you actually follow up). After that, ignore the hell out of everybody and everything! It should be easy with the headphones. If you hear something ignore it. DO NOT make eye contact with any living thing! Because you ABC, and the zen like focus you have cultivated by otherwise being present, those around you will come to accept that with the headphones on your head, you are not there, you may as well be across the galaxy. They'll have to wait.
